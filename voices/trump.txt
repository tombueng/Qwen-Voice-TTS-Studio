Thank you very much. It's a privilege to be here at this forum where leaders in business science art diplomacy and world affairs have gathered for many many years to discuss how we can advance prosperity security and peace. 
I'm here today to represent the interests of the American people and to affirm America's friendship and partnership in building a better world. Like all nations represented at this great forum America hopes for a future in which everyone can prosper. And every child can grow up free from violence poverty and fear. Over the past year we have made extraordinary strides in the US. 
We are lifting up forgotten communities creating exciting new opportunities and helping every American find their path to the American dream. The dream of a great job a safe home and a better life for their children after years of stagnation. The United States is once again experiencing strong economic growth. The stock market is smashing one record after another and has added more than 7 trillion dollars in new wealth since my election.
